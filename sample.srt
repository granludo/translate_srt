1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, now, all over the world, the Toyota pickup truck is marketed as the toughest vehicle money can buy.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to show you an advertisement from Australia, and if you've got any children watching,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
put your fingers in their ears, because it does contain some Australian language.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Bugger.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Bugger.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Bugger me.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Bugger.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Easy now, son.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Ooh, bugger.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Bugger.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And, and, it's not just ad speak either, because whenever you turn on the news,

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
what is it that's always bogging down the enormous American military machine?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, it doesn't matter whether it's Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever,

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you've always got a bunch of guys who rock up in their home clothes with a half-timbered machine gun,

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and look, all of them in a flatbed Toyota.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, it's very popular in Australia and all the other various bits of the third world.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But would it work here? Well, we had to find out.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
For Â£1,000, we got a 13-year-old Hilux diesel, which had done 190,000 miles.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And, judging by the state of it, only ten of them had been done on the road.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We love cars like this on Top Gear.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's why we like the Citroen Berlingo and the Daihatsu Chirag,

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
they're simple, honest-to-God engineering.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But this gives us a problem.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
See, when we get a Porsche to test, we find out how fast it goes,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and we get a Renault Megane, we find out how safe it is.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But this, as you know, is built for strength.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, we've got to find out how tough it is.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's why we brought it to Bristol.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This city has an air of solidity about it.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The paving stones, for instance, are cemented and then nailed in place.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The buildings look planted. It's a Victorian ode to the test of time.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, let's find out how the best-built city in Britain copes with our pick-up truck.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now, this, I want to make it plain, is not Hollywood.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We're not using stuntmen, we're not going to use any computer graphics.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We haven't made any mechanical alterations to the car at all.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We just picked it up from the farmyard and brought it here.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh, dearie me, that was a bit uncomfortable.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It damaged my spine quite badly doing this.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And then it set about...

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
...and then it set about...

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
...and then it set about damaging Bristol.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This didn't really hurt it either.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, battery's good, radiator's good.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That'll buff out.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's got it.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So, we left the city centre and went to the seaside.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'd tried careless driving...

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
...so I thought I'd try a spot of careless parking.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Look what's happened. This is the Severn Estuary,

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
home to the second biggest tide in the world.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
40 feet, and it moves at eight miles an hour.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's why the I and LI have tethered my car in place.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm not going to get that out for hours.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Damn!

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The lifeboatmen and locals thought it was all a huge laugh.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
-So, that's going to drown my car? -Oh, yes.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
-When will I be able to get it out again? -To your ass.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Windscreen's still in.

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But then, disaster.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The ropes tying it down had snapped.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It could be out in the main channel.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You may never see it ever again.

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You don't think you've quite got this?

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We've got to get it back.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Very kindly, they waded out to see if they could find it.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But it had gone.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And it didn't turn up until the tide had gone out five hours later.

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The silt had jammed the steering lock,

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and the cylinders were flooded with seawater.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The boat was now in a state of emergency.

71
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The steering lock and the cylinders were flooded with seawater.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was a wreck.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And though we'd brought a mechanic along, we had no spare parts.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Things looked bleak.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, the mechanic has worked on it now for 40 minutes or so, I think.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And it's not looking good.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Seems then that if you want to kill one of these things,

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you have to reach the sea. Saltwater is the answer.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sorry.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Erm, wrong.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Astonishingly, the Toyota was not dead.

82
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I do not believe it!

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Right, it's started.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now, let's see if it moves.

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
(ALL CHEERING)

86
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So, it had survived the West Country.

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But would it survive our test track?

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The problem is, what can we do here that we haven't already tried?

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Difficult one.

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I mean, the only solid structure we have here

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
is this, the Top Gear production office.

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And that won't stop it.

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The Americans have used daisy cutters on these things, to no avail.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I've got something much more powerful.

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The Mistral GT.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
(GUNSHOTS)

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What do you have to do to kill one?

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ah.

99
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right.

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
A bit undignified, but here we go.

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, lordy, lord. I'm too old for this.

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
(HORN HONKS)

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I honestly can't believe this.

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The steering's fine, the gearbox is fine, the low-range box is fine,

105
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
the brakes are fine.

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Even the speedo's telling me we're doing 30.

107
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
To give you an idea of just how strong this car still is,

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
look what we've got here.

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's used to fell skyscrapers,

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
but look what happens when you thump it into the car.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, the day thou gavest, Lord, is ended.

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But, sadly, the car isn't.

113
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It survived trial by water,

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
it survived trial by Bristol and trial by caravan,

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and the client must face the most difficult trial of them all.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Trial by fire.

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
(WHISTLES)

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That was phenomenal.

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
- Amazing. - Be honest, did you really not change any bits?

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Not a thing, other than the windscreen.

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The sea took the windscreen out, we had to put a new one in

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
for driving through our production office,

123
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
otherwise it'd have taken my head off.

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So we put a new piece of Perspex in, that was it.

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Other than that, nothing. We just had hammers, spanners

126
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and a bit of WD-40 to get the engine going after the sea.

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
All of which makes it more of a shame that, in the end, you killed it with fire.

128
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
- That was churlish. - Well, that's the thing.

129
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You probably won't believe this, ladies and gentlemen.

130
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I want a huge round of applause.

131
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It is still working!

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, my God!

134
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
My God!

135
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Have you ever seen anything like it?

136
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What have you done?

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, dear, it's not quite the same shape.

138
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think the tracking's out.

139
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That was done when it was dropped.

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You'll also notice, if you rock it slightly,

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you can see, if we just bring the camera around here,

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
this headlamp has still got some of the Bristol Channel in it.

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, yes, and you've got a lighter on this corner as well.

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
- That was the tree. - That means it's an MOT failure.

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
- The bonnet did... - I'd like to do something about that.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The bonnet went up, but then the wrecking ball pushed it back down.

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
- The interior, not pretty. - Oh, no, you're right, that is...

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
- Yeah, it's a bit singed. - Yeah.

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I notice, above this enormous rust hole here,

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
there's quite a dent there as well.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That was the sum total of the damage from the caravan.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
- And that little dent there... - What's in here?

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's your desk from the production office. You know you lost it.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
- I used to sit there. - You did, that's bust.

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is quite interesting too. You see this little, er...

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
dent there? That was the wrecking ball.

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That would knock down the Empire State Building. That's all it did.

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And now we're going to talk about our pick-up truck.

159
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You may remember we bought one a couple of weeks ago.

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The idea was we were going to see if you could actually destroy it.

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We tried drowning it in the Bristol Channel.

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We smashed it through the Top Gear production office.

163
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Dropped a caravan on it.

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We hit it with one of those wrecking balls,

165
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and then we set fire to it.

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And it still survived.

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Now, we concluded after that that it was pretty much unkillable.

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Trouble is, though, you see, we were thinking laterally about this,

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and what we needed to do was think vertically.

170

00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This is Rachel Point Tower Block in Hackney, East London.

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
23 storeys of late 1960s dream housing.

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, in a few minutes, this monument to miserable Britain

175
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
will be reduced to a pile of rubble.

176
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The building is meticulously laced with high explosives.

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
When they go off, this street in the sky will be brought down to earth with a bang.

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Ah, you're thinking, "I bet they've parked the old Toyota right next to it."

179
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But you'd be wrong, because we've come up with something much better.

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's 240 feet up.

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We're really not mucking about this time.

183
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There are 12,500 tons of cancelled concrete in this building.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Nothing can possibly survive what is about to happen here.

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
-Do you think it'll survive? -No.

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You never know what's going to happen. It could just disappear in with a pile.

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, but what have you done? You've set fire to it, you've hit it with a wrecking ball,

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you've put it in the sea. I think this will probably finish it off.

189
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
-It's not going to survive. -Do you want to bet?

190
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
-Yeah. -How much? -Â£10.

191
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll have a tenner with you that you won't be able to drive out of.

192
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
-It's going to get expensive, isn't it? -It is.

193
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right, here we go.

194
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

195
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
(EXPLOSIONS)

196
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
(GUNFIRE)

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
(EXPLOSIONS)

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So, the moment of truth. Will it be buried under thousands of tonnes of public housing?

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No. There it is.

200
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
(GUNFIRE)

201
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It may have escaped being buried alive, but that 240-foot drop has taken its toll.

202
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
(GUNFIRE)

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's smashed and bashed almost beyond recognition.

204
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, dear.

205
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'd say that was pretty ronnied. Have you got a crowbar with you?

206
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yep.

207
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Again, we've got our mechanic with us, and as before, he's not allowed spare parts

208
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and he can only use basic tools.

209
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Too much. It doesn't look good.

210
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
-Right, is this it? -Right, this is it. I'm going to give it a go.

211
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

212
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Come on.

213
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
(CHEERING)

214
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Unbelievable.

215
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, OK, James.

216
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
James, now we've seen that it started.

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
-Yeah, it did start. -But did it move?

218
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I can hardly believe this myself. Ladies and gentlemen, here it is!

219
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
(CHEERING)

220
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It has come to life.

221
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes! Yes!

222
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
(LAUGHTER)

223
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Can I... I want to make sure... I want to make sure you're being honest, OK?

224
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is very important. When Jeremy did it, the rules were you couldn't replace any parts.

225
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No spare parts allowed. You did the same. No spare parts.

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No spare parts. The mechanic reconnected the battery, put a bit of diesel in it.

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
-Brum. Off it went. -I just can't believe it. I mean, look at the...

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
-The effect of that. -It's not bad. Taxed worse.

229
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You've taxed worse. Oh, no, look here.

230
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Look, the whole chassis is, well, I was going to say cracked, but split's a better word.

231
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, well, it has actually broken in half right across,

232
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and we're in the strange situation where the bodywork is actually holding the chassis.

233
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
(LAUGHTER)

234
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I honestly... I'm stuck for... I mean, we could carry on trying to destroy it.

235
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But do you know what? I think we should build a plinth. Yeah?

236
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Put it on there as a museum piece for all of time. What do we think? Do we do that?

237
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,240
